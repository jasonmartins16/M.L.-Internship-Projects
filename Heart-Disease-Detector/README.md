# Heart-Disease-Detector
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning algorithms and deploys the solution via FastAPI with an interactive web interface.

# Features
->Machine learning model built with Random Forest Classifier for accurate predictions.

->Data preprocessing with StandardScaler for normalized feature distribution.

->Backend API powered by FastAPI, enabling real-time predictions.

->Web interface built with HTML and Tailwind CSS for user-friendly input.

->Displays both prediction (Normal / Heart Disease) and risk probability.

->Custom threshold adjustment to improve sensitivity for heart disease detection.

# Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Joblib

FastAPI for backend

HTML + Tailwind CSS for frontend

Matplotlib / Seaborn for data visualization
